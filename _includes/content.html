      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer. I didn't start out with an interest in coding, but rather developed an 
        apreciation for its complexity over time. My first experience with coding was JavaScript in high school, 
        and I'll admit it was a rocky start. That all changed when I rediscovered a passion for coding in college. 
        I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. There 
        I learned about algorithms, operating systems, software development, web development, robotics, app design, 
        and much more. I was introduced to many skills and tools of the trade: like C/C++, Java, Assembly, LISP, 
        HTML, and my old friend JavaScript. Outside of schooling I taught myself Python and continue to work on my independent projects. 
        These days I enjoy traveling internationally with friends and family and have now been to such places as Iceland, 
        Norway, and South Korea. I look forward to working in a development role, 
        writing code, and utilizing the skills I have aquired.</p>
